This was made possible by [Giphy](https://giphy.com/). The app receives the still images and gifs from the Giphy API to allow the user to travel anywhere Giphy allows and is displayed in a clean, user intuitive layout for anyone to enjoy. It also displays the given rating for each image/gif.

Tools utilized:
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap (See documentation [here](https://getbootstrap.com/).)
* JavaScript
* jQuery 

# How To Use it
Click on any button to view images related to that destination or you can add your own destination on the form. You can also click on each image to see it animate.
